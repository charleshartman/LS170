*Have a broad understanding of what the internet is and how it works*

The internet is often described as a network of networks. While a network may be as simple as two computers connected by an Ethernet cable and configured to be able to exchange messages, or a slightly larger LAN (local area network) comprised of multiple computers connected to a hub or switch, the internet encompasses a vast number of smaller networks, all connected via a physical infrastructure using copper(coaxial cable), light(fiber optic cable) or air(radio waves). Packets move over this infrastructure and are directed to their destination by routers. To access the internet your computer must connect to a router. That first router may be on your LAN or at your ISP, but the your internet traffic will start at a router and likely move through a number of other routers. The packets that make up your traffic may 'hop' between many routers before eventually making their way to to their ultimate destination.

*Have a broad understanding of flow control and congestion avoidance*

TCP addresses the unreliability inherent in the underlying network. While the internet protocol provides basic error checking on individual packets through checksums, it provides no other features for the reliable transmission of data. The TCP protocol adds a number of features. These additional features do impact performance however. 

*TCP provides:*
- error detection through checksum (checksums that don't match means packet corrupted and should be dropped)
- ordering of packets in correct sequence (no matter when received)
- confirmation that all packets have arrived, if not, missing packets will be requested again
- de-duplication (drop duplicate packets that are already present with confirmed checksum)

TCP can provide feedback to the packet sender if packets are arriving too quickly or too slowly, and thus accomplish flow control. Additionally, if a high number of packets are not arriving or arriving very slowly from a certain route, TCP can take steps to address this and attempt to avoid further congestion.


*Latency and Bandwidth*

**Latency** is a measure of how long it takes for data to move from one point in a network to another point in a network. Latency can be thought of as a measure of delay. A number of factors contribute to this delay. The measurement of latency is usually expressed in milliseconds(ms). Another common expression of latency is **RTT**, or round-trip time, RTT is the time it takes for a message to be sent and a response to be received.

**Bandwidth** is a measure of the amount of data that can be sent across a network connection in a certain amount of time. This is commonly measured in seconds. Bandwidth can, and often will, vary across a network. So your effective bandwidth may best be expressed by the point in your connection where bandwidth is at its lowest. A connection with higher bandwidth that connects to a connection with lower bandwidth may experience a bandwidth bottleneck if the highest connection's bandwidth is saturated.
