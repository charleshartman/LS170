### The Internet

##### Have a broad understanding of what the internet is and how it works

The internet is often described as a network of networks. While a network may be as simple as two computers connected by an Ethernet cable and configured to be able to exchange messages, or a slightly larger LAN (local area network) comprised of multiple computers connected to a hub or switch, the internet encompasses a vast number of smaller networks, all connected via a physical infrastructure using electrical signals(copper cable), light(fiber optic cable) or air(radio waves). Packets move over this infrastructure and are directed to their destination by routers. To access the internet your computer must connect to a router. That first router may be on your LAN or at your ISP, but the your internet traffic will start at a router and likely move through a number of other routers. The packets that make up your traffic may 'hop' between many routers before eventually making their way to to their ultimate destination.

##### Understand the characteristics of the physical network, such as latency and bandwidth

**Latency** is a measure of how long it takes for data to move from one point in a network to another point in a network. Latency can be thought of as a measure of delay. A number of factors contribute to this delay. The measurement of latency is usually expressed in milliseconds(ms). Another common expression of latency is **RTT**, or round-trip time, RTT is the time it takes for a message to be sent and a response to be received.

*Four types of delay can contribute to increased latency:*
- **propagation:** basic time it takes to travel between sender and receiver
- **transmission:** data travel is rarely a straight line between two points, it must move through various routers along the way, this delay type considers the time it takes for data to be "unloaded" from one route and "loaded" unto the next route
- **processing:** introduced as data is processed through the router connections mentioned in transmission delay section
- **queueing:** routers can only process so much data at a time, data may sit in a buffer waiting to be processed, adding queueing delay

**Last mile latency** refers to the increased latency that may occur on the (relatively) smaller pipe between your local network and your ISP, before or after your transmissions move over larger network backbones with great capacity and more powerful routers (in terms of processing capability.

**Bandwidth** is a measure of the amount of data that can be sent across a network connection in a certain amount of time. This is commonly measured in seconds. Bandwidth can, and often will, vary across a network. So your effective bandwidth may best be expressed by the point in your connection where bandwidth is at its lowest. A connection with higher bandwidth that connects to a connection with lower bandwidth may experience a bandwidth bottleneck if the highest connection's bandwidth is saturated.

##### Have a basic understanding of how lower level protocols operate

Building upon the physical network layer, which is the electrical signals(copper), light(fiber optic) or air(radio waves) used to transmit data from one point to another, we have Ethernet, a set of standards and protocols that govern the communications between physical devices on a local network. Ethernet sits at the Data Link/Link layer. The Protocol Data Unit for Ethernet is a **frame**. The Ethernet frame wraps, or encapsulates, the PDU for the Network/Internet layer: an IP **packet**. This IP PDU (packet) in turn wraps the layer above that and so on (more on those layers in other parts of this study guide). Some additional key points on the Ethernet protocol: 

- it inhabits the Data Link/Link layer and sits just above the physical layer. It gives structure to what is essentially a stream of bits coming from the physical layer.
- it is used to enable communication between devices on a local network, while the IP protocol is used to enable communication between devices on different networks that are connected by one or more routers. IP is used for inter-network communication.
- since it governs communications between physical devices on a local network, it is concerned with source and destination MAC addresses rather than IP addresses (again, these are the province of the IP protocol on the Network/Internet layer above which the Ethernet protocol encapsulates 
- MAC addresses are made up of six two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (:), for example `00:09:8c:00:69:63`.

##### Know what an IP address is and what a port number is

IP stands for Internet Protocol. There are two versions of IP currently in use, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bits in length and are comprised of a series of four eight bit numbers, each separated by a period(.). For example, `172.27.1.101`. IPv6 addresses are 128-bits in length and comprised of 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits each, separated by a colons(:). For example, `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`. Both versions of IP are logical and hierarchical in nature.

A port is assigned to a specific process running on a device. By appending a port number to a IP address we can represent a socket. Creating a connection between two processes on two different devices on two different networks. For example, a tab or window in the web browser on our computer may have an assigned ephemeral port of `52193` and our computer may be assigned the IP address of `172.27.1.101`. We then connect to a web server at `201.22.3.98` on port `443`. We now have a connection between `172.27.1.101:52193` and `201.22.3.98:443`.

##### Have an understanding of how DNS works

The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet's phone book. When you type a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into your web browser's address bar you are really asking to connect to a specific IP address on the internet. As it is quite cumbersome to remember countless IP addresses but easy to remember `launch school.com`, DNS keeps track of the IP address that a specific host has been assigned. If the DNS information for a URL has not already been looked up (and cached), a connection is made to a DNS server to ask for the IP address for the URL you are requesting. DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy. If the first DNS server queried does not have the information it will proceed up the DNS hierarchy until it finds the entry. It may then cache the entry for future use to avoid additional lookups of that URL.

##### Understand the client-server model of web interactions, and the role of HTTP as a protocol within that model

Perhaps the most basic web interaction is "visiting" a website. When we do this, our client is requesting a resource from a remote server. Our web browser issues a HTTP request and then processes and displays the response. HTTP is the text based protocol that forms the system of rules for how these requests and responses are formatted and handled. HTTP is a stateless protocol, every request-response interaction is independent of any previous interaction. The server does not retain information about previous visits. Developers must use approaches such as sessions, cookies, and AJAX to simulate state and create stateful web applications.

#### TCP & UDP

##### Have a clear understanding of the TCP and UDP protocols, their similarities and differences

TCP and UDP are both protocols that work at the Transport Layer. TCP is a connection based protocol while UDP is connectionless. This is one of the things that makes UDP faster, unlike TCP it doesn't require a three-way handshake to establish a connection before any data is sent. The PDU for TCP is a segment and the PDU for UDP is a datagram. While TCP includes a number of features that address the unreliability of the underlying network, UDP focuses on speed and flexibility. Both protocols provide multiplexing and both protocols encapsulate the layer above, and in both cases the headers contain information on the source and destination ports as well as a checksum, but the similarities end there. UDP datagram headers contain the length of the datagram in addition to the aforementioned source/destination port information and checksum, but that's it. This means, unlike TDP, UDP provides no packet ordering, no de-duplication and no confirmation (and therefore re-transmission) mechanism. If a UDP datagram is corrupted it is simply dropped, if it is missing then there is no facility for knowing as much... it simply doesn't show up. For this reason UDP is often used in applications where speed and simplicity are crucial and a few dropped datagrams are not application breaking. Examples would be interactive online gaming or audio/video conferencing. UDP is a fat firehose, if a few droplets are lost on the way to the fire, that's the price you pay for the sheer quantity of water you are moving. The point is to put out the fire.


##### Have a broad understanding of the three-way handshake and its purpose

**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol. Application data will not be sent until a connection has been established between application processes. This connection is made using a three-way handshake. The process initiating the connection sends a `SYN` segment, the receiver then responds with an a `SYN ACK` segment. The sender then follows up with a final `ACK` segment. A connection has now been established. The original sender can being sending application data along with the final `ACK` of the handshake. The received cannot begin sending data until it receives the final `ACK` segment of the handshake from the sender. (`SYN` is an abbreviation of synchronize while `ACK` is an abbreviation of acknowledge.)

##### Have a broad understanding of flow control and congestion avoidance

TCP addresses the unreliability inherent in the underlying network. While the Internet protocol provides basic error checking of individual packets through checksums, it provides no other features for the reliable transmission of data. The TCP protocol adds a number of features. These additional features do impact performance however. 

TCP provides:
- error detection through checksum (checksums that do not match means packet corrupted and should be dropped)
- ordering of packets in correct sequence (no matter when received)
- confirmation that all packets have arrived, if not, missing packets will be requested again
- de-duplication (drop duplicate packets that are already present with confirmed checksum)

TCP can accomplish flow control by monitoring the the amount of data awaiting processing in the buffer and adjusting the `WINDOW` field in the TCP header.

Additionally, if a high number of packets are not arriving or arriving very slowly from a certain route, TCP can take steps to address this by adjusting the `WINDOW` to attempt to avoid further congestion.

### URLs

##### Be able to identify the components of a URL, including query strings

Given the url: 
`https://launchschool.com/student/assessments?LS170=pass`

- `https` is the scheme
- `launchschool.com` is the host
- `/student/assessments` is the path
- `?LS170=pass` is the query string
- which is made of query parameter name/value pair `LS170=pass`

##### Be able to construct a valid URL

In addition to the above:
- additional query parameter name/value pairs can be specified by inserting an `&` between name/value pairs. For example: `https://shoes.com/home?color=green&size=large`
- appending a `:` and a port number to the host in a url will direct your request to the application listening on that port, the default listening port for http is 80 and for https is 443, but a port number can be specified to another integer, for example 8006: `https://www.example.com:8006/home`. Note: this assumes that there is actually a web server set up and listening on that port rather than the default one.


##### Have an understanding of what URL encoding is and when it might be used

URLs are designed to accept only certain characters within the standard ASCII character set. Any character outside the default acceptable ones will need to be encoded. This includes "reserved characters" such as `&` and `?`. Since these characters serve a specific purpose in the construction of URLs, if we wish to use them for an unreserved purpose they must be encoded. Generally, all characters **other than** alphanumerics and special characters `$-_.+!'()"` or reserved characters used for their reserved purpose, will need to be encoded. Encoded characters are represented with a `%` symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the ASCII code of the character. For example, a `Space` would be encoded as `%20`.

### HTTP and the Request/Response Cycle

##### Be able to explain what HTTP requests and responses are, and identify the components of each

**HTTP request:** Method and path (aka request-URI) are required, if HTTP 1.0 or greater, then HTTP Version is also required. If HTTP 1.1 then host is required in headers. Parameters, other headers and body are optional. Example:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.hartmanfineart.net
```

**HTTP response:** Status code (and status text) are required, headers (Content-Type et al) and body are optional. Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Sat, 20 Feb 2021 05:13:55 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
```

##### Be able to describe the HTTP request/response cycle

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) follows a simple model in which a client makes a request of a server and then receives and processes the response. The format of these requests and responses adheres to the system of rules defined by the protocol. Because the client and server have agreed to this common set of rules (HTTP), they are able to communicate using relatively simple text based messages. This is possible because the format of the messages has been agreed to, so both sides are able to read and process each other's messages and take the appropriate action. 

##### Be able to explain what status codes are, and provide examples of different status code types

Status codes are part of the HTTP response. They are a three digit number followed by status text that provides a short description of the code. Some common status codes:
- `200` - OK : Request handled successfully.
- `302` - Found : Typically indicates that the resource has been moved, usually automatically redirects to the new location.
- `404` - Not Found : Requested resource not found.
- `500` - Internal Server Error : Generic server error

##### Understand what is meant by 'state' in the context of the web, and be able to explain some techniques that are used to simulate state

HTTP is a stateless protocol, every request-response interaction is independent of any previous interaction. The server does not retain information about previous visits. A single interaction has no awareness of any other interaction. Developers must use approaches such as sessions, cookies, and AJAX to simulate state and create stateful web applications.

- **Sessions:** the server creates a unique identifier, a token that serves as a `session id`, this token is sent to the client and then sent back and forth during future interactions to create a sense of persistence or statefulness.
- **Cookies:** cookies are pieces of data stored on the client that allow the server to maintain a record of state. The server can use the `session id` information stored in the client-side cookie to reference the session data stored on the server.
- **AJAX:** the main feature of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is that it allows the browser to send requests and process responses without reloading/requesting the entire webpage or web application. This drastically reduces the overhead associated with maintaining a connection that seems stateful. It allows certain elements of an application to be updated without reloading everything. AJAX requests are just like normal HTTP requests, the difference is that the response is processed by a `callback` function rather than the browser itself.

##### Explain the difference between `GET` and `POST`, and know when to choose each

`GET` and `POST` are two of the most commonly used HTTP request methods. Essentially, `GET` is about retrieving information and `POST` is about submitting some piece of input or data to a server. While you can send data through a GET request using query strings there is a size limitation on the amount of data that can be sent in this fashion. Also, you would not want to submit any sensitive or private information in the fashion since it is inherently insecure (being send in plaintext right there in the URL!). Data submitted through a `POST` request is contained in the `body` of the request. The `body` may contain HTML, images, audio, etc. or it may be empty.

---

### Security

##### Have an understanding of various security risks that can affect HTTP, and be able to outline measures that can be used to mitigate against these risks

HTTP requests and responses are transmitted in plaintext, so they are essentially insecure. This means a malicious actor might packet sniff and intercept your session id for a site. This could allow them to connect to the same site without ever "logging in" as the server would be interacting with an already logged in session. This is known as session hijacking and can be combated to a lesser to greater degree by the following:
- **resetting sessions:** re-authentication and a new session id is required to do anything important or if session has expired.
- **session expiration:** a time limit is put on sessions, after a certain time, user must re-authenticate/start a new session.
- **use HTTPS across the entire site/web application**, so everything is encrypted and thus not vulnerable to being intercepted as plaintext

Other safeguards:
- Same-origin policy: permits access and interactions between resources originating from the same origin, but restricts access to resources originating from different origins. An origin is the combination of a URL's scheme, hostname and port.

Other concerns:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): security concern when users can submit data like HTML or Javascript through a webform that then gets executed on the server automatically. This can be addressed by sanitizing user input and/or escaping all text input so the browser does not interpret it as code.

##### Be aware of the different services that TLS can provide, and have a broad understanding of each of those services

Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides for secure message exchange over what is inherently an unsecured channel. It does so by adding three services:
- **Encryption:** messages are encoded so that only those that have an authorized key can access the message.
- **Authentication:** provides ability to confirm the identity of a particular party in a message exchange.
- **Integrity:** messages are confirmed to have not been altered or otherwise tampered with during the exchange.
 
 Notes: 
 - TLS is currently at version 1.3. 
 - TLS has replaced Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) but people sometimes still refer to SSL when they mean TLS. Likewise, people may say SSL Certificates but mean TLS Certificates or Public Key Certificates.
 - The TLS handshake occurs after the TCP three-way handshake and adds more overhead/latency since its involves more roundtrips
 - TLS uses asymmetric encryption in order to securely setup up a symmetrically encrypted channel. Sample TLS handshake exchange:
	 - "Hello server, I would like to connect to your **securely**. This is my maximum TLS version and here is the cipher suites I have available to me."
	 - "Great, here is my Public Key Certificate, signed by the relevant authorities, so you know it's really me. And let's use this particular cipher suite. Now use that cipher suite and send me a message (pre-master secret) encrypted with my public key."
	 - "Cool, here is that message encrypted with your public key. I'm on board with these other parameters to apply when generating our symmetric key."
	 - "OK, I have decrypted your message (pre-master secret), I've used that and the parameters we agreed on to generate the same encryption key as you. Now we will communicate using that key for all future exchanges."
	- We can think of TLS as operating between HTTP (Application Layer) and TCP (Transport Layer).
	- The Message Authentication Code (MAC) is part of the meta data of the TLS PDU. It is a hash of the data payload using a pre-agreed algorithm. The receiver hashes the data payload on their end after decrypting the message, if the hash they generate matches the MAC then they know the message has not been tampered with.
	- Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) provides TLS services communications using the UDP protocol at the Transport Layer.
