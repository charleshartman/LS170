*Have a broad understanding of what the internet is and how it works*

The internet is often described as a network of networks. While a network may be as simple as two computers connected by an Ethernet cable and configured to be able to exchange messages, or a slightly larger LAN (local area network) comprised of multiple computers connected to a hub or switch, the internet encompasses a vast number of smaller networks, all connected via a physical infrastructure using electrical signals(copper cable), light(fiber optic cable) or air(radio waves). Packets move over this infrastructure and are directed to their destination by routers. To access the internet your computer must connect to a router. That first router may be on your LAN or at your ISP, but the your internet traffic will start at a router and likely move through a number of other routers. The packets that make up your traffic may 'hop' between many routers before eventually making their way to to their ultimate destination.

*Understand the characteristics of the physical network, such as latency and bandwidth*

**Latency** is a measure of how long it takes for data to move from one point in a network to another point in a network. Latency can be thought of as a measure of delay. A number of factors contribute to this delay. The measurement of latency is usually expressed in milliseconds(ms). Another common expression of latency is **RTT**, or round-trip time, RTT is the time it takes for a message to be sent and a response to be received.

Four types of delay can contribute to increased latency:
- propagation: basic time it takes to travel between sender and receiver
- transmission: data travel is rarely a straight line between two points, it must move through various routers along the way, this delay type considers the time it takes for data to be "unloaded" from one route and "loaded" unto the next route
- processing: introduced as data is processed through the router connections mentioned in transmission delay section
- queueing: routers can only process so much data at a time, data may sit in a buffer waiting to be processed, adding queueing delay

**Last mile latency** refers to the increased latency that may occur on the (relatively) smaller pipe between your local network and your ISP, before or after your transmissions move over larger network backbones with great capacity and more powerful routers (in terms of processing capability.

**Bandwidth** is a measure of the amount of data that can be sent across a network connection in a certain amount of time. This is commonly measured in seconds. Bandwidth can, and often will, vary across a network. So your effective bandwidth may best be expressed by the point in your connection where bandwidth is at its lowest. A connection with higher bandwidth that connects to a connection with lower bandwidth may experience a bandwidth bottleneck if the highest connection's bandwidth is saturated.

*Have a basic understanding of how lower level protocols operate*

Building upon the physical network layer, which is the electrical signals(copper), light(fiber optic) or air(radio waves) used to transmit data from one point to another, we have Ethernet, a set of standards and protocols that govern the communications between physical devices on a local network. Ethernet sits at the Data Link/Link layer. The Protocol Data Unit for Ethernet is a **frame**. The Ethernet frame wraps, or encapsulates, the PDU for the Network/Internet layer: an IP **packet**. This IP PDU in turn wraps the layer above that and so on (more on those layers in other parts of this study guide). The key point here is that the Ethernet protocol is used to enable communication between devices on a local network, while the IP protocol is used to enable communication between devices on different networks that are connected by one or more routers. IP is used for inter-network communication. 

*Know what an IP address is and what a port number is*

IP stands for Internet Protocol. There are two versions of IP currently in use, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bits in length and are comprised of a series of four eight bit numbers, each separated by a period(.). For example, `172.27.1.101`. IPv6 addresses are 128-bits in length and comprised of 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits each, separated by a colons(:). For example, `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`. Both versions of IP are logical and hierarchical in nature.

A port is assigned to a specific process running on a device. By appending a port number to a IP address we can represent a socket. Creating a connection between two processes on two different devices on two different networks. For example, a tab or window in the web browser on our computer may have an assigned ephemeral port of `52193` and our computer may be assigned the IP address of `172.27.1.101`. We then connect to a web server at `201.22.3.98` on port `443`. We now have a connection between `172.27.1.101:52193` and `201.22.3.98:443`.

*Have a clear understanding of the TCP and UDP protocols, their similarities and differences*

TCP and UDP both work at the Transport Layer

*Have a broad understanding of the three-way handshake and its purpose*

**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol. Application data will not be sent until a connection has been established between application processes. This connection is made using a three-way handshake. The process initiating the connection sends a `SYN` segment, the receiver then responds with an a `SYN ACK` segment. The sender then follows up with a final `ACK` segment. A connection has now been established. The original sender can being sending application data along with the final `ACK` of the handshake. The received cannot begin sending data until it receives the final `ACK` segment of the handshake from the sender.

*Have a broad understanding of flow control and congestion avoidance*

TCP addresses the unreliability inherent in the underlying network. While the internet protocol provides basic error checking of individual packets through checksums, it provides no other features for the reliable transmission of data. The TCP protocol adds a number of features. These additional features do impact performance however. 

TCP provides:
- error detection through checksum (checksums that do not match means packet corrupted and should be dropped)
- ordering of packets in correct sequence (no matter when received)
- confirmation that all packets have arrived, if not, missing packets will be requested again
- de-duplication (drop duplicate packets that are already present with confirmed checksum)

TCP can accomplish flow control by monitoring the the amount of data awaiting processing in the buffer and adjusting the `WINDOW` field in the TCP header.

Additionally, if a high number of packets are not arriving or arriving very slowly from a certain route, TCP can take steps to address this by adjusting the `WINDOW` to attempt to avoid further congestion.
